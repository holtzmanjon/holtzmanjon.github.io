### Music

I have enjoyed playing acoustic music since I was a teenager. I played banjo for a long time before somehow I got tired of hearing myself, and have
switched largely to playing mandolin. I can play some basic guitar. Largely bluegrass style.

While an undergraduate at Wesleyan University, I was in a bluegrass
band called Up For Grass, with Craig Edwards, Tom Randall, Kevin
Wimmer, and Tom Gherlein.  (I also played keyboards in a garage
rock and roll band called Broken Hearts with Ezra Palmer, Ken
Kimmell, Tom Parkinson, and Neil Richman).  While in Flagstaff, I
played in the Out of the Woods bluegrass band with Bill Vernieu, Julie
Sullivan, Maureen Smiley, and Pat Kirkham.

In Las Cruces, I took mandolin lessons for several years with [Steve Smith](https://desertnight.com/), 
and participated in several [Desert Nites mandolin camps](https://dnamusiccamp.com/home).
I've also enjoyed playing music with my friend and colleague [Joe Burchett](https://www.joeburchett.com/).
