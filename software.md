### Software

I've worked on a number of software projects over the years. I won't claim to any amazing programming competence, but some
of these may be of utility to someone and are hosted on GitHub:

[pyvista](https://pyvista.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  ( [Github][(http://github.com/holtzmanjon/pyvista))  : a Python package for analysis and reduction of astronomical data. 

[holtztools](http://github.com/holtzmanjon/tools) : some simple useful Python tools for plotting and a few other things

[xvista](http://github.com/holtzmanjon/xvista) : a software package, written largely in Fortran, for the reduction and analysis of astronomical data developed in the 1980s at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I ported it to Unix system and have been responsible for upkeep and worldwide distribution. There are still a handful of users!
 
[APOsong](https://aposong.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ( [Github](http://github.com/holtzmanjon/APOsong) ) : software for the Apache Point Observatory SONG node

[APOalpyca](http://github.com/holtzmanjon/APOalpyca) : custom ASCOM Alpaca drivers for a few components of APO SONG
