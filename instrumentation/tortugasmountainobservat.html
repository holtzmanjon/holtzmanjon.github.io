		The purpose of this document is to provide a common format for HTML
		files so that style sheets can be distributed and updated that can be
		applied across a wide variety of web documents.  Some extraneous tags
		are added for future compatibility, and may not be used currently. 
		We've tried to keep the document semantically clean.
		
		This is the starting point for a document that wants to inherit the
		look and feel of the NMSU site without having to manually duplicate the
		page style.  Be aware that if you hack the document structure,
		future changes to the CSS might cause your hacks to	break.  A better
		approach would be to override the NMSU styles with your own, leaving
		the document structure alone.
		
		Special thanks to W3C, A List Apart, Zeldman, CSS Zen Garden, and
		others who have provided valuable knowledge and examples over the years
		to make web publishing as clean as it is today.  This document borrows
		elements from many of these people/organizations.

					<a name="anchor_37127"></a><h1>News</h1><a name="anchor_37128"></a><h2>Tortugas Mountain Observatory renovation underway</h2><a name="anchor_37129"></a><p>A
 team of NMSU engineering students, along with an astronomy professor, 
has set out to make the Tortugas Mountain Observatory operational once 
again. Clyde Tombaugh, discoverer of Pluto, along with others played an 
important role in the design, development and operation of the 24-inch 
telescope that sits atop A mountain, which fell out of use.</p>

<p>The observatory was built in the 1960s and for 25 years the telescope
 was used extensively to monitor a variety of planetary activities. 
Because the observatory was built 50 years ago the equipment is 
outdated. The College of Engineering Manufacturing Technology 
Engineering Center was asked by the astronomy department to upgrade the 
telescope and the observatory's dome and door, so that all three could 
be computer-controlled, rather than manually operated. The changes will 
allow data to be collected from the telescope remotely and should 
improve the telescope's performance and efficiency.</p>

					</div><a name="anchor_37131"></a><p>In 1974, astronomy professor Reta Beebe took over as head of the planetary group, replacing Brad Smith and Clyde Tombaugh.</p>

<p>When Beebe heard that restoration of the telescope was underway, she 
said, "I think it's great. It served the role of providing information 
for targeting the Voyager mission of Jupiter and Saturn. But after that 
it wasn't possible to get federal funding for a regular program there."</p>

<p>NMSU astronomy professor Jon Holtzman is responsible for overseeing 
the revitalization project from funding and design to construction. For 
him, this update of the observatory has been a long time coming.</p>

<p>"We identified people outside the university who would be interested.
 Last year, we signed an agreement with the American Association of 
Variable Star Observers," Holtzman said.</p>

<p>The telescope will primarily be used by AAVSO, with certain times 
reserved for university use. It will be used to monitor time-variable 
sources-stars that change in brightness over time.</p>

<p>Presently, the university uses Apache Point Observatory, a modern 
observatory operated by NMSU in the Sacramento Mountains. Holtzman says 
the refurbished telescope will provide the university with another 
educational tool to expand research and public outreach, and allow 
amateurs and professionals from around the world to use the facility.</p>

<p>Official planning for the project begin in summer 2010, and the M-TEC
 crew, led by manager and lab instructor Charlie Park, started work on 
the project in December 2010.</p>

<p>"We're about anywhere between 60-75 percent being done. The work 
involves many different disciplines in one project, which is good for 
the students," Park said.</p>

<p>Seven students from a variety of engineering disciplines are working 
under Park's supervision: Lute Stierman, Gabe Moreno, Caleb Sokoll, 
Jeffery Hutchins, Chris Remley, Josh Garcia and Jose Alanis.</p>

<p>The crew has been tasked with automating the door, dome and 
telescope, which involves mechanical, structural and electrical 
engineering. The students are split into three groups to perform a 
variety of tasks.</p>

<p>They are calculating the motor power necessary to open and close the 
bay doors, then designing a new motor to replace a hand crank that once 
was used to open and close doors. They also will design a solar-powered 
system that will supply the power necessary to operate the doors.</p>

<p>They will design and implement a rotational racking device to monitor
 and control the dome's positioning using a pre-existing rotational 
motor. Using electrical, mechanical and manufacturing engineering 
principles, they will automate the two-axis movement of the telescope.</p>

<p>Finally, they will integrate all components to be compatible with the
 software system that networks the bay doors, dome rotation and 
telescope axial controls to the Internet, enabling telescope operation 
from anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>The students involved have learned a considerable amount about the 
observatory and telescope itself. Moreno, a mechanical engineering 
student who has been working with M-TEC for more than a year, views the 
hands-on experience as an important opportunity to work successfully as a
 team.</p>
