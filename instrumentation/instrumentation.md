### Instrumentation

##### Hubble Space Telescope

I had originally planned to develop a dissertation using data from the Hubble Space Telescope. However, the Challenger disaster in 1987 put an 
end to those plans. Still, half of my dissertation was on developing methodology for doing stellar photometry on undersampled images. 

I moved to Lowell Observatory to work with Bill Baum and Deidre
Hunter as part of the WF/PC Instrument Definition Team. I spend a
lot of time at Goddard after the launch of HST in 1990, and was
deeply involved in the diagnosis of the optical spherical aberration
present in the telescope, as well as with its correction in the
Wide Field Planetary Camera 2.

The top panel is a montage of images taken with the WF/PC on the HST shortly after launch in 1990 at a wide range of positions of the HST secondary mirror that provided a coarse focus run. The bottom panel is a set of simulated images for the HST pupil function with a half-wave of spherical aberration. These were the images shown to HST/NASA management that firmly convinced everybody that there was an optical issue with the as-built telescope. Despite the disappointment at the time, working with Sandy Faber and the WF/PC team in our offices at Bowie State Univerisity, generating pages and pages of simulated images which we compared with observed images to diagnose the issue, was a tremendous experience that has stuck with me to the current day. And, of course, the HST story has a happy ending!


##### Sloan Digital Sky Survey

I've been involved in several aspects of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey:
   - I was closely involved with the development of the APOGEE project, which
obtained high resolution near-IR spectra of about 600,000 Milky Way stars. I served as the Survey Scientist for the SDSS-IV portion
of APOGEE;
   - the SDSS-II supernova survey that was conducted 2005-2007; I
developed techniques for the consistent measurement of SN brightnesses
against arbiratry galaxy backgrounds using data obtained from different telescopes

##### Metallicity distribution functions in Local Group dwarfs

##### Stellar populations in the Local Group

[Resolved stellar populations photometry](http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/holtz/dwarfs/dwarfs.htm): One of my primary interests is
in studying stellar populations in the Local Group through photometry of
individual stars. Much of this work was done using the Hubble
Space Telescope. A large <a href=http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/logphot>
stellar photometry archive </a> been constructed from all photometry
done by the WFPC2 in the Local Group. I'm also working on a project
to study the star formation history of the solar neighborhood by
incorporating detailed chemical abundance measurements.

#####  External galaxies

I am interested in structural properties of galaxies,
in particular disk galaxies and the nature of bulges; I've been involved
in both photometric and spectroscopic studies. I've also been studying
properties of galaxies as a function of their environment.

##### Star clusters

 A separate research interest is in the properties of
young, compact, massive star clusters. This was motivated by our initial
discovery of a population of bright blue clusters in NGC 1275 that helped
to spark the development of this field.

##### Cosmology

 For my dissertation, I did cosmological calculations using linear
perturbation theory to calculate observational predictions for large scale
structure and cosmic microwave background anisotropies. I still maintain
a strong interest in understanding the interplay between cosmology and
the formation and evolution of galaxies.
