### Instrumentation

##### Hubble Space Telescope

I had originally planned to develop a dissertation using data from the Hubble Space Telescope. However, the Challenger disaster in 1987 put an 
end to those plans. Still, half of my dissertation was on developing methodology for doing stellar photometry on undersampled images. 

I moved to Lowell Observatory to work with Bill Baum and Deidre
Hunter as part of the WF/PC Instrument Definition Team. I spend a
lot of time at Goddard after the launch of HST in 1990, and was
deeply involved in the diagnosis of the optical spherical aberration
present in the telescope, as well as with its correction in the
Wide Field Planetary Camera 2.

The top panel is a montage of images taken with the WF/PC on the
HST shortly after launch in 1990 at a wide range of positions of
the HST secondary mirror that provided a coarse focus run. The
bottom panel is a set of simulated images for the HST pupil function
with a half-wave of spherical aberration. These were the images
shown to HST/NASA management that firmly convinced everybody that
there was an optical issue with the as-built telescope. Despite the
disappointment at the time, working with Sandy Faber and the WF/PC
team in our offices at Bowie State Univerisity, generating pages
and pages of simulated images which we compared with observed images
to diagnose the issue, was a tremendous experience that has stuck
with me to the current day. And, of course, the HST story has a
happy ending!
