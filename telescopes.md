### Telescope Projects

 - [Apache Point Observatory (APO)](www.apo.nmsu.edu). NMSU has a 15% share of the 3.5m telescope. I have served as the Project Scientist for the 3.5m.

 - [SONG project at APO](astronomy.nmsu.edu/song-wiki)

 - Before SONG, NMSU operated another 1m telescope at APO. I spent a large amount of time
getting this telescope to work! I had it runnning in a fully robotic mode,
with fiber feed to the SDSS APOGEE instrument; it was used for photometric
monitoring of various variable stars, supernovae followup, etc.
