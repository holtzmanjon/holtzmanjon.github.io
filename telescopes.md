### Telescope Projects

 - [Apache Point Observatory (APO)](www.apo.nmsu.edu). NMSU has a
 15% share of the 3.5m telescope. I have served as the Project
 Scientist for the 3.5m.

 - [SONG project at APO](astronomy.nmsu.edu/song-wiki). NMSU was funded to build a SONG node at APO. We purchased a Planewave 1m telescope and constructed a high resolution, fiber-fed spectrograph based off an existing design. I have developed a full suite of software to allow robotic operation of the facility and coordination with the SONG network.

 - Before SONG, NMSU operated another 1m telescope at APO. I spent a large amount of time
getting this telescope to work! I had it runnning in a fully robotic mode,
with fiber feed to the SDSS APOGEE instrument; it was used for photometric
monitoring of various variable stars, supernovae followup, etc.

 - heliostat at Sunspot Visitor's Center. A fun project since retirement has been to get the heliostat located outside the Visitor's Center functional again. This feeds a display inside that projects an image of the Sun on a physical screen, and also makes a visual image of the solar spectrum that visitors can explore by moving to see different parts of the spectrum .... including a lot of absorption lines!
