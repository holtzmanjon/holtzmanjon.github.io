**Overview**

[Curriculum vitae](vitae.pdf)

- I grew up in Baltimore MD, received my B.A. and M.S. at Wesleyan
University, and got my Ph.D. at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
I spent six years working as a research associate at the Lowell Observatory
in Flagstaff AZ before moving to New Mexico State University in 1995.
- My main research interests are in stellar populations, galaxies, and
cosmology. I also enjoy working with data analysis and astronomical
instrumentation.
- I have been fortunate to have been involved with work on the Hubble
Space Telescope: I was an associate member of the Instrument Definition
Team for the original WF/PC camera, and a full member of the IDT for the
WFPC2 camera. I was closely involved with the initial work on diagnosing
the optical problem with the telescope and determining how it could be
corrected with new instruments.  I served on the Science Oversight Committee
for the WFC3 camera that was installed in the HST in 2009.
- I've also been fortunate to have been involved with projects at
the [Apache Point Observatory](www.apo.nmsu.edu), as
Project Scientist for the ARC 3.5m telescope, and through
involvement with several [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](www.sdss.org)  
projects, most notably the Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE); I served as the Survey Scientist
for the APOGEE-2 project of SDSS-IV, and am serving as Commissioning
Scientist for SDSS-V. I also serve on the ARC Board of Governors.
