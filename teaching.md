### Teaching

I taught a variety of classes at NMSU:

- <a href="http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/holtz/a535/index.html"> ASTR 535 (Observational Techniques) </a> : a graduate class for first year graduate students. During the last several offerings, the class was taught in a fully flipped mode, where students watched videos before class, and classes
were dedicated to discussion and practice.
- <a href="http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/holtz/a630"> ASTR 630 (Numerical and Statistical Methods): </a> graduate class, also offered in a flipped format.
- <a href="http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/holtz/a110/index.html"> ASTR 110 (Introduction to Astronomy)</a>: our introductory class for undergraduates
- <a href="http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/holtz/a555/index.html"> ASTR 555 (Galaxies): </a> graduate class
-  HON331 (Using a Telescope: Observation, Technology, and Analysis
in Astronomical Research): an undergraduate honors class where students complete a small research project using the NMSU 1m telescope
